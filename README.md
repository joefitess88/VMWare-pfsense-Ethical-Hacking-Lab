# VMWare-pfsense-Ethical-Hacking-Lab
VMWare pfsense Ethical Hacking Lab for the Austin Peay State University Cybersecurity Club

I created this lab for an Ethical Hacking course that I am taking. The intent is to help those that are unfamiliar with VMWare and pfsese how to set up the environment and keep a stable internet connection. 

One issue that became prevalent in the beginning of this project was network stability. Each one of us spent countless hours trying to figure out how to tie everything together and control it with pfsense. Working with pfsense has shown to be a valuable tool, especially if you are going to use it in a hardware environment. Of course, in our scenario, we are in a virtualized environment. 

Any questions that you might have, ASK!

Enjoy
